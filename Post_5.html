	<i>Storytelling & Independent Games</i></center></blogtitle>
 <br>
	 
<p1>
During the pursuit of my MFA at The University of California at Davis, I inadvertently took an experimental video games class and learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_jamming" target="_blank">culture jamming</a>, interactive storytelling, and game production. The class was written, developed, and taught by <a href="http://patrick-lemieux.com" target="_blank">Professor Patrick LeMieux</a> (who would later become an advisor on my MFA thesis) and was titled “object-oriented programming” as the class was in a place of transition. I was trying to learn how to code so I registered for it and by the time I figured out it was a games design class, it was too late to drop it. I was skeptical because I had only ever played games casually on my phone but it turned out to be one of the best classes I have ever taken. <br><br> 
Over the duration of ten weeks, we explored a variety of independent games while learning how to build our own in Unity. I discovered that I am intrigued by interactive storytelling, especially when an 8 bit aesthetic is incorporated. The low-fi visuals disarm the player and there is an element of humour and nostalgia. 
<br><br> 
One of my favorite games is <a href="https://freegames.org/dys4ia/" target="_blank">Dys4ia</a> by Anna Anthropy, also known as Auntie Pixelante. Dys4ia is an abstract, autobiographical game that Anthropy developed to recount her experiences of gender dysphoria and hormone replacement therapy. I found playing the game to be possibly more affecting than listening to a story or watching a film because Anthropy’s dilemmas and frustrating tribulations become the players’ experience for the duration of game. Anthropy’s story still resonates with me more than a year later.

While I was at the V&A last week, I took the opportunity to visit the <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/videogames" target="_blank">Videogames: Design/Play/Disrupt</a> exhibition which explores the design and culture of contemporary videogames since the mid-2000s. The internet, connective technologies, access to powerful software, and the invention of social media have changed the way games are designed, played, discovered, and discussed.
	<br><br> 
My favorite areas of the <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/about-videogames-exhibition" target="_blank">exhibition</a> were the <i>disrupt</i> and <i>play</i> areas. Games are no longer only produced by big studios with large teams of designers, producers, storywriters, and developers. Games can be developed independently, allowing the voices of non-cisgender white males to be heard. 
	 <br><br> 
	In the disrupt area, there was a wonderful multi-panel video presenting some of the people involved in designing and promoting independent games such as hybrid developer/designers <a href="https://medium.com/@cypheroftyr" target="_blank">Tanya De Pass</a>, <a href="http://ramiismail.com/game-developer/" target="_blank">Rami Ismail</a>, and <a href="http://ninasays.so/games/" target="_blank">Nina Freeman</a>. Sociologist and critic <a href="https://medium.com/@Quinnae_Moon" target="_blank">Katherine Cross</a> and USC Games Professor <a href="http://www.richardlemarchand.com" target="_blank">Richard Lemarchand</a> are also featured. Most of these people were new to me and I intend to research them in more depth at a later date. I was surprised <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/16/anita-sarkeesian-its-frustrating-to-be-known-as-the-woman-who-survived-gamergate" target="_blank">Anita Sarkeesian</a> was not profiled as she has been famously vocal about sexist tropes in mainstream video games.
	<br><br>

In the play area, there were 20 or more tactile games. My favorite was the LED chasing game <a href="http://wobblylabs.com/projects/wobbler" target="_blank">Line Wobbler</a> by Robin Baumgarten. Baumgarten describes the game “as a one-dimensional dungeon crawler game with a unique wobble controller made out of a door-stopper spring and a several meter long ultrabright LED strip display. The entire game runs on an Arduino, including sound, particle effects and 60+fps.” <br><br>

It was fantastic to see a game like this – simple, fun, and made with accessible hardware and software. I have never thought about an LED strip as a gaming device. Brilliant!  Line Wobbler won the Game Design Award at <a href="https://www.indiecade.com" target="_blank">IndieCade 2015</a> in Los Angeles, and the Best Game Design, Best Presentation, and the Audience Awards at <a href="https://expo.nikkeibp.co.jp/tgs/2018/exhibition/english/sown/" target="_blank">Sense of Wonder Night</a> at the Tokyo Game Show 2016. Well done Robin! <br><br> 
Back in the spring of 2017, I made a game for my final project in the experimental game design class. It’s not biographical – except I did (do?) a lot of emotional eating in graduate school. It’s called Hungry Ball and is inspired by Pac Man. It’s free at <a href="https://maxgames.itch.io/hungry-ball" target="_blank">itch.io</a>. Let me know what you think!
